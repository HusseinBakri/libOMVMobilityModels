This folder is empty becuase it contains more than 300 files and GitHub deos not allow such upload of files

Please copy the folder named "openmetaverse_data"  which contains the clothes of avatars among other things (.tga files needed like glove_lenth_alpha.tga and shirt_collar_alpha.tga etc..)
from LibOpenMetaverse [after you build the library successfully depending on your OS]
to here or to the Visual Studio/MonoDevelop bin folder, to solve the problem of naked avatars.

Also don't forget to add as references in your MS Visual Studio the following dlls:
"openjpeg-dotnet.dll" and "openjpeg-dotnet-x86_64.dll" otherwise your avatars will look like clouds.

Enjoy!
